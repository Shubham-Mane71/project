#1 STL library  (STL.cpp + Demo.cpp)

I developed a custom C++ library similar to the Standard Template Library (STL), where I implemented various generic data structures such as singly linked list,
doubly linked list, circular linked list, stack, and queue using templates. The main objective of this project was to understand how these data structures work 
internally and to make them reusable like a header file-based library. All the functions such as insertion, deletion, display, and searching are implemented in a 
modular way, and the library can be included in any C++ program using just #include. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of memory management,
pointers, object-oriented programming, and templates. It helped me improve my problem-solving skills and write clean, reusable, and efficient code that can be used
in real-time applications.

#2 Customized Database Management System  (CDBMS.java)

My project is a Customized Database Management System (CDBMS) developed using Java, which works like a mini version of SQL-based databases. Instead of using MySQL or any external database, I implemented the entire system using Linked List data structure to store student records dynamically in memory. Each record contains Roll Number (auto-generated), Name, City, and Marks. The system accepts user commands in SQL-like format through the console, such as Insert_Into_Table, SelectStarFrom, SelectCount, SumMarks, AverageMarks, UpdateCity, and DeleteFromTableWhere. These commands perform operations like inserting data, displaying the table, updating a student’s city, deleting records, and calculating aggregate values like minimum, maximum, average, and sum of marks. I also created a manual and help command to guide the user about syntax and available features. This project helped me understand how a DBMS works internally—such as data storage, command parsing, CRUD operations, and query execution—while improving my knowledge of Java, OOP concepts, data structures, and logic-building.
