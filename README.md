# STL library

I developed a custom C++ library similar to the Standard Template Library (STL), where I implemented various generic data structures such as singly linked list,
doubly linked list, circular linked list, stack, and queue using templates. The main objective of this project was to understand how these data structures work 
internally and to make them reusable like a header file-based library. All the functions such as insertion, deletion, display, and searching are implemented in a 
modular way, and the library can be included in any C++ program using just #include. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of memory management,
pointers, object-oriented programming, and templates. It helped me improve my problem-solving skills and write clean, reusable, and efficient code that can be used
in real-time applications.
